# Customer-Churn-Prediction-with-an-Artificial-Neural-Network-ANN-
This project aims to build a machine learning model, based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), that predicts the likelihood of a bank customer leaving the institution. Customer churn prediction is critical for businesses looking to retain clients and minimize revenue loss.
